<h1>Recreating the Leo stack</h1>

<p>This describes the procedure for recreating a Leo stack.
Leo stacks will be defined below.

<p>A parse item is a LIM or an EIM.
Every parse item has a confluence set,
which is a set of one or more confluences.
A confluence indicates a reason why the parse item was added
to the Earley table.

<p>A confluence is a duple of mainstem and tributary.  It is the pair of
parse items which caused the creation of a parse item.  In an ambiguous
parse, parse items may have more than one confluence.
I have previously called the mainstems, predecessors;
and called the tributaries, causes, components or bases.
We can write a confluence as <tt>[ m, t ]</tt>,
where <tt>m</tt> is the mainstem
and <tt>t</tt> is the tributary.
If the confluence is a Leo confluence
(that is, if it is the result of a Leo reduction)
the mainstem will be ill-defined, or a LIM;
and the tributary will be an EIM.

<p>A Leo stack is a sequence of EIM's, where all but the first
EIM is the tributary of its predecessor.  The first EIM in the sequence
is the top of the stack, and the last EIM is the bottom.

<p>Below is pseudo-code for recreating the Leo stack for a
confluence of a top EIM, call it <tt>top</tt>.
Let the confluence be
<tt>[lim0, baseEIM]</tt>.
Both <tt>top</tt>
and <tt>baseEIM</tt> are in the same ES, call it <tt>currentES</tt>.
We note that <tt>top</tt> may have more than
one confluence, and the others may be either Leo or ordinary confluences.

<p>We also note that we treat <tt>currentES</tt>,
and the confluence set of each parse item,
as sets.
This means that "adding" an element to the set is a no-op if the
element already exists in the set.
Implementations must avoid adding duplicate EIM's and confluences.
In Libmarpa, the nulled EIMs are added at the same time,
but the logic to do this is not shown here.

<pre>
workingLIM = lim0
previousCompletion = baseEIM
currentES <font face="serif">is the ES for</font> top
while workingLIM is well-defined
do
    <font face="serif"># LIMs always have exactly one confluence</font>
    [ previousLIM, workingBase ] = confluence(workingLIM)
    <font face="serif">Let</font> completion <font face="serif">be a new EIM such that</font>
        DR(completion) = Next(DR(workingBase))
        Origin(completion) = Origin(workingBase)
    <font face="serif">Add</font> completion <font face="serif">to</font> currentES.
    <font face="serif">Add the confluence</font> [ workingBase, previousCompletion ]<!--
        --> <font face="serif">to the confluence set of</font> completion.
    workingLIM = previousLIM
    previousCompletion = completion
done
</pre>
